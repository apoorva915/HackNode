## üìñ Usage Guide

### Web Interface

1. **Open the Dashboard**: Navigate to http://localhost:5000
2. **Enter Address**: Input any cryptocurrency address in the search bar
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze" to start the analysis
4. **View Results**: Explore the comprehensive analysis results:
   - Transaction statistics
   - End receiver predictions with confidence scores
   - Interactive transaction flow graph
   - Detailed transaction history

### Command Line Interface

#### Basic Address Detection
```bash
# Detect cryptocurrency type from address
python blocktracker_cli.py -w 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6
```

#### Transaction Tracking
```bash
# Track transactions from an address
python blocktracker_cli.py -t 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6
```

#### Full Analysis
```bash
# Comprehensive analysis with end receiver detection
python blocktracker_cli.py -a 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6
```

#### Generate Graphs
```bash
# Create transaction flow graphs
python blocktracker_cli.py -g 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6
```

#### Multiple Addresses
```bash
# Analyze multiple addresses at once
python blocktracker_cli.py -a address1 address2 address3
```

## üîß API Endpoints

The web interface is backed by a RESTful API:

### Analyze Address
```http
POST /api/analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6"
}
```

### Detect Currency
```http
POST /api/currency-detect
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6"
}
```

### Get Transaction Graph
```http
POST /api/transaction-graph
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6"
}
```

### Health Check
```http
GET /api/health
```

## üìä Understanding the Results

### End Receiver Analysis
The system identifies potential end receivers with probability scores:

- **High Confidence (70%+)**: Strong evidence this is the final destination
- **Medium Confidence (40-70%)**: Moderate evidence, worth investigating
- **Low Confidence (<40%)**: Weak evidence, may be intermediate address

### Transaction Flow Graph
- **Nodes**: Represent wallet addresses
- **Edges**: Show transaction flows with amounts and timestamps
- **Colors**: Different colors for different cryptocurrencies
- **Interactive**: Zoom, pan, and hover for details

### Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Transactions**: Complete transaction count
- **Incoming/Outgoing**: Direction of fund flows
- **Total Volume**: Sum of all transaction amounts
- **Analysis Time**: When the analysis was performed

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Cryptocurrencies
1. Extend the `BlockchainTracker` class in `core/blockchain_tracker.py`
2. Add new API integration methods
3. Update the `detect_currency` method
4. Add new visualization options

### Modifying the Web Interface
- Edit `templates/index.html` for frontend changes
- Modify `app.py` for backend API changes
- Update CSS in the HTML file for styling

### CLI Enhancements
- Add new command-line arguments in `blocktracker_cli.py`
- Implement new analysis functions
- Extend the help documentation

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect blockchain API rate limits
- **Data Privacy**: Be mindful of blockchain data privacy implications
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local regulations

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No transactions found"
- Check if the address is valid
- Verify the cryptocurrency is supported
- Ensure API keys are configured correctly

#### "Network error"
- Check internet connection
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Check API rate limits

#### "Import error"
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify file paths and imports

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed error information:
```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python app.py
```

## üìà Performance Tips

- **Batch Analysis**: Use the CLI for analyzing multiple addresses
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid repeated API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API limits
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple addresses can be analyzed simultaneously
